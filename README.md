Digitization of load energy usage readings over the internet. The proposed
system design eliminates the involvement of human in electricity maintenance. The user can monitor energy
consumption in watts from a webpage by providing a channel id for the load. The Webpage utilizes the
THINGSPEAK analytics to analyze the energy usage to give more detailed description and visualization of the
energy usage statistics. Wi Fi unit performs IOT operation by sending energy data of the load to the webpage
which can be accessed through the channel id of the device.
